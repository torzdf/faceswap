""" The default options for the faceswap VGG Face2 recognition plugin.


Defaults files should be named `<plugin_name>_defaults.py`

Any qualifying items placed into this file will automatically get added to the relevant config
.ini files within the faceswap/config folder and added to the relevant GUI settings page.

The following variable should be defined:

    Parameters
    ----------
    HELPTEXT: str
        A string describing what this plugin does

Further plugin configuration options are assigned using:
>>> <config_item> = ConfigItem(...)

where <config_item> is the name of the configuration option to be added (lower-case, alpha-numeric
+ underscore only) and ConfigItem(...) is the [`~lib.config.objects.ConfigItem`] data for the
option.

See the docstring/ReadtheDocs documentation required parameters for the ConfigItem object.
Items will be grouped together as per their `group` parameter, but otherwise will be processed in
the order that they are added to this module.
